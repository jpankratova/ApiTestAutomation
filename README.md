# API Test Automation Project

Welcome to the **API Test Automation** project!
This project demonstrates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API testing using **Java**, **RestAssured**, **WireMock**, and **Cucumber**.

It includes:

- âœ… Mocked API server (WireMock)
- âœ… Dynamic request payloads (using Faker)
- âœ… Positive and negative scenarios
- âœ… Localization testing (German / English)
- âœ… Full end-to-end dynamic user testing (Create âž” Fetch âž” Update âž” Delete)

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **RestAssured** (HTTP requests)
- **WireMock** (mock server)
- **Cucumber 7** (BDD test framework)
- **Maven** (build automation)
- **Faker** (dynamic random test data)

## How to Run the Tests

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-link>
cd api-test-automation
```

### 2. Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8+

Make sure Java and Maven are installed and available from your terminal:

```bash
java -version
mvn -version
```

### 3. Run Tests with Maven

Run all tests:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest='*CucumberTestRunner'
```

âœ… This will:

- Start a WireMock server
- Run Cucumber scenarios
- Send API requests (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Validate API responses

### 4. Run Specific Feature

You can run a specific feature (e.g., only user tests):

```bash
mvn clean test -Dcucumber.features=src/test/resources/features/user.feature
```

## Available API Endpoints (Mocked by WireMock)

| Method | Endpoint         | Description         |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| POST   | /user            | Create a user       |
| GET    | /user/{username} | Get user details    |
| PUT    | /user/{username} | Update user details |
| DELETE | /user/{username} | Delete user         |

**Localization:**

- `Accept-Language: de` returns German error messages.
- Default returns English errors.

---

## Example Scenarios

- Create a user successfully
- Create a user with missing fields (negative validation)
- Get existing user
- Get unknown user (404 error)
- Delete existing user
- Delete unknown user (404 error)
- Update existing user
- Update unknown user (404 error)
- ðŸ”„ End-to-End dynamic scenario: Create âž” Fetch âž” Update âž” Delete user with dynamically generated data
